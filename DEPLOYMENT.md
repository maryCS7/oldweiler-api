- **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS (free with Vercel/Railway)
- **Email**: Professional email setup

## 🔧 **Environment Variables I Need to Set**

```bash
# Required for Production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
RESEND_API_KEY=my_resend_api_key_here
ENV=production

# My frontend domains (comma-separated)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://oldweilercustomcarpentry.com,https://www.oldweilercustomcarpentry.com

# My Business Info
FROM_EMAIL=info@oldweilercustomcarpentry.com
TO_EMAIL=mary.schroth719@gmail.com
COMPANY_NAME=Oldweiler Custom Carpentry
COMPANY_LOCATION=Bennington, NY
```

## 📊 **What I Can Monitor**

### **Built-in Monitoring (Already Working)**
- **API Docs**: `https://my-api.railway.app/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://my-api.railway.app/health`
- **OpenAPI**: `https://my-api.railway.app/openapi.json`

### **What I'll Watch For**
- [ ] **Health endpoint** returns "healthy" status
- [ ] **Database connectivity** stays working
- [ ] **Email service** sends messages successfully
- [ ] **Rate limiting** protects against spam

## 🚨 **Testing My Live App**

### **I'll Test These Endpoints**
1. **`GET /`** - Welcome message
2. **`GET /health`** - Health check
3. **`GET /reviews/`** - Get reviews
4. **`POST /contact/`** - Submit contact form
5. **`GET /docs`** - API documentation

### **Common Issues I Might Face**
- **CORS errors**: I'll check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes my frontend domain
- **Database errors**: I'll verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- **Email failures**: I'll check `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid
- **Rate limiting**: I'll test with multiple rapid requests

## 🎯 **I'm Ready to Deploy!**

My app is now **production-ready** with everything I need:
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Production database support
- ✅ CORS security
- ✅ Email service integration
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive frontend
